      <h2>Cleopatra's Tomb</h2>

      <!-- main cleopatra content -->
      <p>Cleopatra VII Philopator, the last Pharaoh of ancient Egypt, is a figure wrapped in legend, power, and romance.
        Known for her intelligence, political acumen, and dramatic alliances with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony,
        Cleopatra’s life story has fascinated historians for centuries. Yet, despite all we know about her reign, one of
        the greatest mysteries remains: the location of her tomb.
        Ancient sources hint that Cleopatra and Mark Antony were buried together in a grand mausoleum somewhere near the
        ancient city of Alexandria, possibly in a temple dedicated to Osiris, the god of the afterlife. However, the
        exact site has never been found. Over the millennia, earthquakes, rising sea levels, and urban expansion have
        buried or destroyed much of Alexandria’s ancient landscape, complicating archaeological efforts.
        Modern expeditions and underwater searches continue to probe the Mediterranean seabed near Alexandria, hoping to
        uncover ruins that could reveal the queen’s final resting place. Discovering Cleopatra’s tomb would not only
        solve a historical puzzle but could provide priceless insights into Ptolemaic burial practices and the legacy of
        one of history’s most powerful women.
        The mystery endures, inspiring countless books, films, and quests — a testament to Cleopatra’s enduring allure
        and the secrets still hidden beneath the sands and waves of Egypt.
