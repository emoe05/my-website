1. Contrast, from the four design principles in Chapter 16: please consider adding an a:hover setting in your styles.css so that when a visitor to the website moves their cursor over a link on the navigation menu specifically, it changes colors to indicate that it is clickable.

For number 1, I added a hover effect in my styles.css file to enlarge the text to 150% when the user hovers. This is located on line 61.

2. Repetition, from the four design principles in Chapter 16: line 137, index.html. Please consider adding some sort of "return to top" link since all of your pages requires vertical scroll.

I created the footer links section and added a return to top button. This was added on line 143 of index.html.

3. On the homepage the list under "modern" looks like it is not lined up with everything else on the page

4. Also on the homepage I think that wrapping the modern, ancient and supernatural sections in boxes would look nice

5. The photos on the homepage are a bit small and hard to see, maybe remove them or put them under the lists so they can be a smidge bigger without looking off.

I added new section ids for the sections in the homepage. From there, I uses this section id to create boxes for the sections. I also used this to affect the images inside to make them look nicer and not too big or too small. Finally, the text is no longer being pushed by the images no thats the images reside under the text instead. This solution fixed all three suggestions.
